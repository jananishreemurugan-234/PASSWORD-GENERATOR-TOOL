# PASSWORD-GENERATOR-TOOL

## Project Overview

Weak passwords are one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity. Many people use simple, predictable passwords like 123456 or password, which can be easily cracked by attackers. To tackle this issue, we built a Password Generator Tool as part of the RISE Internship Python Programming Project.

This tool helps users generate strong, random, and secure passwords based on their preferences. It allows customization of password length, inclusion of digits, and special characters. Additionally, the tool can save generated passwords to a file and copy them directly to the clipboard for easy use.

By working on this project, students and beginners can practice important Python concepts like loops, functions, the random module, and string handling.

## Objective

Create a simple CLI-based Python tool to generate secure passwords.

Allow user customization (length, numbers, symbols).

Provide options to save passwords for future reference.

Add optional clipboard support for convenience.

## Requirements

Python 3.13.6

Modules used:

random → random selection of characters

string → predefined character sets like letters, digits, punctuation

pyperclip (optional) → to copy generated password to clipboard

## Features

User chooses password length

Option to include digits and special characters

Randomized secure password generation

Password automatically saved to passwords.txt

Clipboard copy support (if pyperclip is installed)

Beginner-friendly code with modular structure

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.


2. Save the code in a file named password_generator.py.


3. Open terminal/command prompt and run:

python password_generator.py


4. Follow the on-screen instructions:

Enter password length

Choose whether to include digits

Choose whether to include special characters


5. Your password will be displayed, saved in a file, and optionally copied to the clipboard.

 
## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, learners will:

Understand the importance of cybersecurity and password strength.

Practice Python basics (input handling, loops, conditionals).

Work with randomization and string manipulation.

Learn how to save data to files and use external libraries.

Build a real-world tool useful in daily life.


## Future Improvements

Add a Tkinter GUI version for easier usage.

Option to generate multiple passwords at once.

Add password strength checker before saving.

Integration with a password manager tool.


## Outcome

This project results in a security-focused tool that generates strong and customizable passwords. It not only improves the user’s online safety but also strengthens Python programming skills.

## Conclusion

The Password Generator Tool project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-world security problems. By generating strong and unpredictable passwords, the tool reduces the risk of weak password usage, which is a major cause of data breaches.

Through this project, I practiced important programming concepts such as randomization, string handling, user input validation, file handling, and optional library usage for clipboard support. The tool is simple yet powerful and can be further extended with features like a graphical interface, strength checker, and integration with password managers.
